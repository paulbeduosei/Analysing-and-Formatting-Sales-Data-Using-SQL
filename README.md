# Analysing-and-Formatting-Sales-Data
A SQL data-cleaning project using a hypothetical Super Store dataset — and it turned out to be a great way to sharpen my real-world analytics workflow 🧹📊

In this project, I identified the top product categories by profit margin, cleaned missing values, validated data types, and applied SQL transformations to ensure accurate reporting.

Data cleaning may not be glamorous, but it’s the backbone of every reliable insight — and I always enjoy the challenge of turning messy datasets into something meaningful and analysis-ready.
